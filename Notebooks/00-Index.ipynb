    "# Analysis of Head-to-Head LDC Fitness Competitions\n",
    "### This notebook contains the analysis of the raw data Belinda obtained during her time in the lab as a McNair Scholar in 2018.  Single mutant knock out strains were in Synechococcus 7942 and performed classic head-to head fitness competition experiments\n",
    "Prepared by David Welkie \n",
    "March 8, 2019\n",
    "UCSD\n",

    "* This experiment adjusted the experimental design to switch from using 24 well plates to full sized petri plates to characterize the fitness relationships against WT in the strain synpcc7942_0863.\n",
    "* In addition we tested if light intensity affected fitness.\n",
