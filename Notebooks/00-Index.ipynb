    "# Analysis of Head-to-Head LDC Fitness Competitions\n",
    "### This notebook contains the analysis of the raw data Belinda obtained during her time in the lab as a McNair Scholar in 2018.  Single mutant knock out strains were in Synechococcus 7942 and performed classic head-to head fitness competition experiments\n",
    "Prepared by David Welkie \n",

    "### 1. Initial Experiment on different strains against WT selected based on RB-TnSeq DataSet:     <a href=01-Initial-mutant-wt.ipynb> 01-Initial-mutant-wt </a>\n",
    "* These consist of the mutants against WT-spsm:\n",
    "  * synpcc7942_0863 hypothetical (1.5)\n",
    "  * synpcc7942_0644 cikA (1.4)\n",

    "* This experiment adjusted the experimental design to switch from using 24 well plates to full sized petri plates to characterize the fitness relationships against WT in the strain synpcc7942_0863.\n",
    "* In addition we tested if light intensity affected fitness.\n",

    "* Measured growth of individual strain synpcc7942_0863 and WT in LDC to determine if fitness effect is due to increased growth rate\n",
